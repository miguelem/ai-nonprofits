# AI Automation for Nonprofits

## What is AI Automation?

Most nonprofits use AI manually: typing prompts into ChatGPT and copying results around. This is like fetching water with a bucket. **AI automation is building the plumbing**: once set up, work flows automatically without human intervention.

The goal isn't to replace staff. It's to eliminate repetitive, grinding tasks so your team can focus on meaningful work like building relationships and driving impact.

**Problems with manual AI:**
- Inconsistent results depending on who's prompting and how
- You're still the "middleman" copy-pasting between tools
- Impossible to scale (you can't manually generate 5,000 thank-you notes)

**Why nonprofits especially benefit:**
- Small teams wearing many hats need a "digital intern" that never sleeps
- Tight budgets mean you can't hire more staff, but you can multiply what existing staff accomplish
- Mission-driven employees burn out on paperwork; automation removes the drudgery

## Use Cases

**General operations:** auto-summarizing meetings, translating emails, digitizing paper forms, triaging inboxes, monitoring compliance changes.

**Fundraising:** monitoring grant databases for new RFPs, auto-segmenting donors in your CRM, generating personalized thank-you messages based on giving history.

**Marketing:** repurposing blog posts into social media content, monitoring mentions and comments, curating weekly newsletters from industry news.

**Programs:** triaging urgent beneficiary requests via SMS alerts, extracting impact stories from field reports, transcribing voice notes into database entries.

**HR & Operations:** automating volunteer onboarding, categorizing expense receipts, screening resumes, tracking contract renewals.

## Types of AI Automation

**1. AI Chatbot Automation:** Schedule recurring tasks inside tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity (e.g., "Every Monday, summarize last week's volunteer activity").
- ✅ Easy to start, no setup needed
- ❌ Limited integrations with external tools like your CRM

**2. Embedded AI:** Use the automation features already built into tools you have (HubSpot, Mailchimp, Salesforce, etc.).
- ✅ Almost no setup, safe for sensitive data
- ❌ Limited to that tool's capabilities and AI quality

**3. AI Workflows:** Platforms like Zapier, Make, or n8n connect multiple tools together with AI steps in between.
- ✅ Very flexible, integrates with thousands of apps
- ❌ More complex to configure, costs can grow with usage volume

**4. AI Agents:** Define a goal and the agent plans and executes the steps autonomously (e.g., "Find lapsing donors and send re-engagement messages").
- ✅ Handles complex, unstructured multi-step work
- ❌ Less reliable and harder to control; best used cautiously

**5. AI Browsers:** Browsers like Perplexity Comet that can browse websites and extract structured data for you.
- ✅ Good for web research and data collection
- ❌ Slow, can get "lost," and introduces security risks if given access to sensitive accounts

**Where to start:**
- Brand new? Try embedded features in tools you already use
- Want more power? Move to Zapier or Make
- Complex needs? Explore SaaS AI agents

## How to Implement (Checklist)

1. **Discover:** Have your team log repetitive tasks for one week, then rank by time consumed
2. **Pick one task:** high impact, low risk, straightforward
3. **Assess risk:** What happens if it makes a mistake? Add human review if the answer is "something bad"
4. **Select tools:** Use free trials with test data only (never real data first)
5. **Test thoroughly:** Run 10+ realistic scenarios, including edge cases; have someone try to break it
6. **Pilot:** Launch small, check outputs daily the first week, gather feedback
7. **Measure for 30 days:** Track time saved, errors, and team satisfaction, then decide to keep, adjust, or scrap
8. **Document and assign ownership:** One primary owner, one backup, a simple one-page guide, and a 90-day check-in reminder

## Common Risks to Avoid

- **Automating the wrong thing:** Focus on genuine bottlenecks, not just what's easy to automate
- **Automating a broken process:** Fix and simplify the workflow on paper *before* automating it
- **Scope creep:** Finish one automation before starting the next
- **Staff resistance:** Involve your team early, be transparent about job security, train well
- **Surprise costs:** Set hard billing caps on API usage and account for setup and maintenance time
- **No rollback plan:** Keep documented manual processes as a backup
- **Tool dependency:** Document workflows well enough that you could rebuild them in a different tool
- **No ownership:** Every automation needs a named owner who checks it monthly and knows how to fix it
